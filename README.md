# MicroCraft

A small, Python‑based game inspired by **Minecraft** and **Terraria**.  
This project is both a learning exercise and a fun sandbox for experimenting with game systems.

## 🎮 Overview & Concept

MicroCraft blends block‑building, resource gathering, and procedural world generation in a compact, manageable setting.  
Rather than a large-scale 3D world or full multiplayer, the focus is on core gameplay mechanics and experimentation.

### Core Mechanics & Features (current / planned)

- Place and destroy blocks  
- Gather resources by mining / breaking blocks  
- Inventory / storage management  
- Day / night cycle (light and darkness effects)  
- Procedural world generation (chunks, terrain variation)  
- Physics: gravity, collision detection (where relevant)  
- Lighting / shadow system (visible surfaces, ambient light)  
- Efficient rendering (only visible faces rendered)  
- (Optional future) crafting system, creatures/enemies, biomes, survival modes  

Note: The project is in active development; not every feature may be fully implemented at all times.

## 🧩 Modding (Yes, you can)

By the way — you’re totally free to make a mod if you want. Add new blocks, tweak behavior, change lighting — whatever. I’ve got a [Wiki](https://github.com/HazDu/MicroCraftGame/wiki/3.-Modding) where you can find notes and tips for modding. It’s not a massive framework, but it should give you a starting place.

## 🖼️ Background & Motivation

This project originated as a way to:

- Learn game development in Python with hands‑on practice  
- Explore rendering, world data structures, and procedural algorithms  
- Build a sandbox project with room for expansion

## 📐 Architecture & Technologies

The game is written in **Python** and uses external libraries for graphics, input, and data handling.

### Dependencies & External Libraries

Depending on the exact code state, common dependencies might include:

- `pygame`  
- `numpy`  
- `json`  
- `os`, `sys`  
- `zipfile`  
- `platform`  
- `math`
